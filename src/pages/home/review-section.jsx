                    <p>Christine and Kelly were incredibly quiet while
                        I was working from home. They were professional
                        and courteous and got to work right away , not
                        time  wasted. They asked me several questions
                        to ensure  things were being done as I wanted.
                        Great team, great service. Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Natty and Lyn did a great job of cleaning my
                        2 -storey home. They were professional,
                        efficient, friendly and I would highly
                        recommend. Thank you for the sanitized
